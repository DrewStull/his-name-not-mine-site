    <p>It’s simple, God calls us to serve the orphans and widows of this earth.</p>
    <blockquote>
      James 1:27 — "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And that’s what we plan to do. Service should not be done for our own sake but because we are made to be servants of the Lord. So if you’re a widow, orphan, or really anyone that needs help, reach out and we will if we can. Whether it’s simple or complicated, time consuming or quick, labor or social, we got it. We’ve got friends that are masters of trades, computers, business, and more. If you ask, we will figure out how to assist.

    <h2>About the Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Too many Christians have become weak. They are doing acts of service to feel better about themselves or for their own salvation. But God deserves our service because he is Lord. That’s the reason we should serve. Doing what is right for the wrong reason is still wrong.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Mathew 6:21-23 — "Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'"
